            As mentioned earlier, in professional terms I consider myself to be
            a Senior Front End Web Developer, Website Consultant, and
            Professional Floor Installer.
          </p>

          <p>
            My day-to-day schedule is labor during the day and tech in the
            evening. During the day, Monday through Friday, I install flooring
            as an independent contractor on a specialist crew, for Nationwide
            Flooring. In the Evenings I power on my custom-built Linux-powered
            development desktop and help make the world wide web a better place.
            Or more specifically, I am a freelance web developer &amp;
            consultant for hire.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my free time, I'm sure I share quite a few hobbies and leisurely
            activities that you do. I love a good laugh, so going to comedy
            shows isn't out of the question. I love to learn, so diving into a
            few good books or articles can take up entire days if I let it. I
            also enjoy healthy, fun, exercises that are outdoors including
            skateboarding and road bicycling.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently, I am on track to have a great year, with an even better
            year lined up to follow! If you would like to know more about me,
            continue reading. Or you can get in touch with me by email or by

          <p>

          <p>
            Of course, there is a lot more information that could be brought up
            to describe me. Much more than could reasonably fit on a web page,
            so I'll keep it brief with a little history, what I'm up to now, and
            what my upcoming plans are.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl mb-2">A Little History</h3>

          <p>
            I was born and raised in the Midwest Region of the United States of
            America. My family settled into a house my father constructed just
            outside of a small city in Wisconsin. Farms and industrial factories
            were merely a few miles away, as well as downtown commercial
            districts and a major regional airport.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have fond memories of playing outside in the country fresh air
            without an immediate concern in the world. I had opportunities to
            explore forests, rolling hills, valleys with rivers, and other
            fascinating outdoor places of interest. I also have equally fond
            memories of staying indoors on cold winter days, either cuddled up
            in a warm bedroom or home office.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because it was the U.S Midwest, all 4 seasons were thoroughly
            endured or enjoyed, and that developed a personal level of general
            preparedness. Working outside or inside, be prepared for extremely
            cold snowstorms during the winter and hot/muggy summer days is a
            Midwestern staple of life. This transcends region though, as it is
            present in my own approaches to professional work.
          </p>

          <p>
            This mixture of outdoor activity and indoor endurance helped
            influence my hobbies in the way of both physical performance and
            technical development. Skateboarding, snowboarding, bicycling, and
            many more outdoor activities have helped me stay in shape all my
            life; as they still do! A harsh winter snow-in can produce deep
            self-reflection and introverted successes whether it's artistic or
            technical.
          </p>

          <p>
            I grew up in an era where traditional media really started to take
            off thanks to modern digital inventions such as the personal home
            computer. I spent many nights pouring through comic books and short
            fictional stories getting completely lost in fantasy worlds. This
            was the spark and start to a lifelong hobby of creative pursuits
            like sketching and 3d modeling. Even in Elementary grade notebooks,
            I have the pages lined with doodles and drawings. From my own
            personal comic books to tattoos designs all the way up to my own
            complete brand designs, creativity has always been a fuel for my
            passions.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I was still young, home computers and entertainment systems
            started becoming more widely available, and I was lucky enough to
            get some access early on. Because of this introduction to computers
            early enough, I immediately became fascinated with how they work.
            This lead to a lifelong hobby of computer building and programming.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was gifted my first "Gaming PC" from my brother when I was in high
            school, and that's when my technical pursuits really took off. I
            started by updating components to improve performance, and that lead
            to tweaking game configuration files. Configuring a game's settings
            files manually is what ultimately introduced me to scripting, which
            planted the seed that eventually grew into a professional career in
            Website Development.
          </p>

          <p>
            Of course, no life journey would be complete without a few years of
            semi-lost wandering, life-changing moments, and wisdom forming
            adventures. From high school post graduation to my first day of
            college 6 years later, was filled with Minimum Wage jobs, couch
            surfing, a few mistakes, fun trips, but most importantly: life
            lessons. I learned a lot in my Twenties, and I have taken the last
            decade under my own critical lens, applying lessons as new goals for
            the next 10. I'm always getting better.
          </p>

          <p>
            One year, I decided to reapply for some grants to see if I could get
            financial aid to go to college; honestly just for a change in
            scenery. My only goal was to get a degree in something technical for
            the knowledge and life experience. Upon being awarded grants, I
            looked to family for work to make ends meet for my education. My
            uncle just happened to land a large remodel &amp; new construction
            job on a lake house and invited me to be his primary helper as a
            general contractor.
          </p>

          <p>
            As much as I enjoyed the work, before I graduated I landed a job at
            a small marketing agency as their first employee; a junior web
            developer. It was an amazing couple of years, learning about
            important design principles, brand management, and of course
            building front-end web development skills. From Junior to Senior, I
            excelled into managing the companies development direction and staff
            as mentor/trainee. A great introduction to the industry for the
            following few more years.
          </p>

          <p>
            After the agency I moved on to work for a local newspaper, and
            another local agency, before ultimately deciding it was time for a
            change in direction in my life. I needed to get back in shape, get
            back to helping individuals with specialty work, and a focus on
            quality over quantity. The office life is great, don't get me wrong;
            but it's not the best, because the best is subjective. It was time
            for me to move onwards and upwards!
          </p>

          <p>
            Cut to today, and you'll find me installing fine flooring products
            in homes and business all over the Chippewa Valley as my 9 to 5.
            When appropriate, I take on freelance web development and
            consultation client work; completed at my home office.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have struck a nice balance of work, life, passion, exercise, and
            happiness. I like to believe that reflecting on past experiences is
            the best way to re-evaluate current situations and plan for
            tomorrow. I also like to believe that my life has shaped a unique
            and worthwhile perspective, and that applies to every one I meet as
            well.
          </p>

          <p>
            I don't know what's next in store for me, but I'm looking forward to
            all of it!
